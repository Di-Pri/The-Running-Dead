This project was built in 2020, during the first semester of my study course at KEA. The first big project where I used Javascript.

An animated clicker game with good objects that give you points and bad objects that take your game lives. The idea is to collect a certain amount of points before the time runs out and have at least one life left at the end of the game.

The game is based on a mood board, sketches, wireframes, paper prototype, activity diagram, peer feedback, style tile, and state machine diagram.

All graphic elements are SVGâ€™s and were designed by me using Adobe Illustrator. Clicking objects sounds were recorded by me and edited using Adobe Audition. 

Animations were coded using CSS keyframe animations. JavaScript functions control the start and end of animations, points, lives, timer, and click events. There is a possibility to mute the sound and pause the game.
